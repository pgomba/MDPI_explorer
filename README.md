`MDPIexploreR` provides comprehensive tools to scrape and analyze data from the MDPI journals. It allows users to extract metrics such as submission-to-acceptance times, article types, and whether articles are part of special issues. The package can also visualize this information through plots. Additionally, `MDPIexploreR` offers tools to explore patterns of self-citations within articles and provides insights into guest-edited special issues.
