Lets find closed special issues journal Plants, year 2021 2023: explore role guest editors special issues, can use URLs guest_editor_info() function. example use function sample five articles: function outputs table several columns, including: number papers special issue (excluding editorial-type articles), number articles authored guest editor (flags), ratio articles flags (prop_flag), indicates fraction articles authored guest editors special issue. Additional columns include deadline special issue, date last article submission, much time, , submission exceeded deadline. rt_sum_vector2 column provides count guest editor, representing number papers authored special issue.
